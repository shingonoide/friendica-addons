Secure Mail
-----------

Send notification mails to user encrypted with GPG.
Each user can enable it and submit his public key under Settings-> Addon
-> "Secure Mail" Settings.

Use 'openpgp-php' library, a pure PHP implementation of GPG/PGP.
See [project repo](https://github.com/singpolyma/openpgp-php).

Need Friendica version > 3.3.2 to work.
