Language Filter
===============

This addon allows users to define a list of languages in which postings shall
be displayed. Postings in other languages will be collapsed, so the user can
still read them if desired. When no language could be detected (this usually
happens with short postings) the posting will be shown.

It is based on the NSFW addon and filters the postings based on the language
detected by Text_LanguageDetect package that is bundled with friendica.

Please note, the language detection is not perfect. You should not trust it
blindly and we will not be responsible for postings you don't see because
they got wrongly hidden by this addon.
