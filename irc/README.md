IRC App
=======

This addon will add an app to your page which will allow your users to access
the [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC) at [freenode.net](https://freenode.net) via a webinterface from your node. The chat interface
will be loaded in an iframe from webchat.freenode.net.

You can specify two sets of channel lists.

1. a list of channels the interface shall automatically connect to
2. a list of popular channels which will be displayed aside the chat interface.
   the channels in this list will be linked so your users can easily join them.

If you don't specify a list of popular channels, the following will be shown: friendica, chat, chatback, hottub, ircbar, dateroom, debian

Users can set their own list of channels in the settings.
